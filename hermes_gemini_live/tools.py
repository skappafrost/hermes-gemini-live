"""The tools this voice lane offers the model.

Deliberately a small set of verbs over one delegate rather than Hermes' real tool list: the
api_server runs the whole toolset server-side, so shipping 30 JSON schemas into the setup
frame would spend tokens on every call to describe capabilities the model is not good at
using from audio. One "do this work" call plus the two that make multi-tasking honest —
``hermes_tasks`` to read the board, ``hermes_task_update`` to answer or redirect a task that
is waiting. Without those two the model can start work but never finish it: a run parked on
an approval is invisible to it, and a second request forces a duplicate run.

#: What the model may do to a task already on the board. One list on purpose: the enum the
#: declaration offers and the verbs the relay acts on must never drift apart.
#: There is no "approve": the model also reads untrusted text (room audio, run output), so it
#: must never be the one that unlocks a dangerous command. Approval is a user press on the
#: Desktop control, which reaches the relay as a renderer frame (see relay._user_approval).

    "calling it, say in one short sentence that you are on it, then stay quiet until the "
    "result arrives. Never invent the result. Several tasks can run at once, and the user may "
    "ask about one while another is still going: check hermes_tasks before starting anything "
    "they might already have asked for."
