"""The tools this voice lane offers the model.

Deliberately a small set of verbs over one delegate rather than Hermes' real tool list: the
api_server runs the whole toolset server-side, so shipping 30 JSON schemas into the setup
frame would spend tokens on every call to describe capabilities the model is not good at
using from audio. One "do this work" call plus the two that make multi-tasking honest —
``hermes_tasks`` to read the board, ``hermes_task_update`` to answer or redirect a task that
is waiting. Without those two the model can start work but never finish it: a run parked on
an approval is invisible to it, and a second request forces a duplicate run.

    "result arrives. Never invent the result. Several tasks can run at once, and the user may "
    "ask about one while another is still going: check hermes_tasks before starting anything "
    "they might already have asked for."
